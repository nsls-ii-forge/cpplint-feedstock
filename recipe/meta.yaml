about:
  description: |
    Cpplint is a command-line tool to check C/C++ files for style issues
    following Google's C++ style guide. Cpplint is developed and maintained by
    Google Inc. at google/styleguide, also see see the wikipedia entry.

    While Google maintains cpplint, Google is not (very) responsive to issues
    and pull requests, this fork aims to be (somewhat) more open to add fixes to
    cpplint to enable fixes, when those fixes make cpplint usable in wider
    contexts.
